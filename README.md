**Alpha**: 
Sends Ajax request to the locally hosted Flask server for dynamically adding input to a currently active sheet.
Currently a naive method to edit an excel sheet. 

**Further improvements**:
1. Stylize popup.html
2. Circumvent using a local server
    1. Fork Microsoft's chrome extension that opens excel within chrome?
    2. Use Google's native Sheets program?
3. Add functionality to where the sheet saves the input
